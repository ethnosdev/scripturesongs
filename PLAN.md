Currently the app streams the songs. I would like to change the app so that it only downloads the songs before it plays them. The first time a user presses the play button for a song in a collection, the app will ask the user if they want to download all of the songs in the collection. If yes, then show a download dialog that shows the progress of the downloads for all of the songs. If no, then only download the current song. After this, playing a song in this collection will only download the current song if it hasn't been downloaded before. 

The audio player should still loop over all of the songs in the collection, but if a song hasn't been downloaded when it arrives then pause until it is downloaded and then play it.
